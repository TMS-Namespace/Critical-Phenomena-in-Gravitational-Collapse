# Critical Phenomena in a Spherically Symmetric Gravitational Collapse of Massless Scalar Field

 This is a part of old research work.

 The part presented here, aims to replicate the critical phenomena during the gravitational collapse, that was discovered by Choptuik (see the PDF file for references), when there is a spherical symmetry and a massless scalar field as a source.

## Contents

This repository contains the following files:

 1. Guide.pdf: contains some theoretical background, and a description of the used numerical methods in the simulation.
 2. simulation.cpp: the core C++ v11 code for simulation, written using Qt v5.4 framework.
 3. Plotter.nb: a Wolfram Mathematica v.11 notebook file. It contains the logic to analyze the simulation-generated raw data, and generate the plots introduced in the PDF file.
 4. Raw Simulation Results: contains multiple files, that contain tab separated, simulation row data.
